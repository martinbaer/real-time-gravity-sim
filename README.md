# Space Clicker

Space Clicker is the continuation of my project N-Body Gravity Simulation. It is a browser gravity sim written in Rust and compiled into WebAssembly. This was my first Rust project so I took this as a learning opportunity by re-writing all of the C++ code from this original project.

It is currently a work-in-progress.
